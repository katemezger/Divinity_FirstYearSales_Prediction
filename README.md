# Divinity_FirstYearSales_Prediction

### Created using Google Colab

Using Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts/libraries, I was able to create a predictive model to determine an estimation of the first-year sales of Divinity by Larian Studios. 

## data_cleaning.ipynb : 

This was used to combine data gathered on Kaggle and information on the Larian Studios hit Baldur's Gate 3. This had to be added manually since the Kaggle data set only went up to 2020. The file was also used to clean any off and incorrect data to make a final clean file for the prediction model. 

## divinity_model.ipynb : 

This was used to create and train the ML prediction model, which would then be used to predict a final sales number. In this file, I also included a presentation on the AI "thought process" to make it clearer how it functions and makes it's descions. 


#### All csv files were used for data collection and cleaning
